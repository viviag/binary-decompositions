# Hensel

Initial functionality consists of an algorithm of factorization of monic square-free polynomials over modular rings into unitary irreducibles.

This topic is closely related to error-correcting codes and I expect to add some functionality related to it. At least transfer several related gists to this repo, probably with dependency on bitvec package.

I also hope to constraint input data and check the property of being square-free. Sometimes.
